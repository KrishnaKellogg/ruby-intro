# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
#puts 5
#puts 3

# Perform simple math with numbers
#puts 5 * 3
#puts 5 / 3  

# Strings
#puts "Hello, world!"

# Combine strings together

#puts "tacos" + 3.to_s


# Variables
#food = "tacos"
#puts food 

# Combine strings and variables

#x = 10
#y = 40 

#puts "#{x+y} tacos" 

# String manipulation
puts "how are you today?".upcase
